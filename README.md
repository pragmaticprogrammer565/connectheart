# connectheart
ConnectHeart follows a layered, modular architecture: UI (screens/components) → Presentation (state, navigation) → Domain (use cases) → Data (repositories, mappers) → Platform (network, storage). This structure improves testability, code reuse, and team scalability, inspired by real-world sample apps and established README guidance.
